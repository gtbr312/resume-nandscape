# Nandscape

Nandscape is a hobby project developed in a game-jam style development process. My primary goal was to leverage React, Redux, and Css3 to create a convincing point and click 2.5D game environment.

## Instructions 
Nandscape can be launched with the standard start script. Once loaded, simply click to walk.
